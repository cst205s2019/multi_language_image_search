# multi_language_image_search

Some searches yield much more interesting results in different languages. One example is "hotspring". if you search for it in English, you get a few image results showing Yellowstone National Park, a few images of hot tubs, and a few hot springs people can enter. However, if you chose translate hot spring to Japanese, it would translate your search to 温泉, and the results are very different since there is a hot spring culture in japan.
